Many autoantibodies are associated with SLE and are considered potential diagnostic markers, but systematic screening and validation of such autoantibodies is lacking. This study aimed to systematically discover new autoantibodies that may be good biomarkers for use in SLE diagnosis.METHODS: Sera from 15 SLE patients and 5 healthy volunteers were analysed using human proteome microarrays to identify candidate SLE-related autoantibodies. The results were validated by screening of sera from 107 SLE patients, 94 healthy volunteers and 60 disease controls using focussed arrays comprised of autoantigens corresponding to the identified candidate antibodies. Logistic regression was used to derive and validate autoantibody panels that can discriminate SLE disease'], ['growing'], ['cognitive, and mental health']]",?,?,?
