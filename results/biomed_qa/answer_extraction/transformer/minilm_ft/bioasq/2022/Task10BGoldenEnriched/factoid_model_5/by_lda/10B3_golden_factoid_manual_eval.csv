Through which pathway does the FTO-guided demethylation of GADD46 drive myogenesis?,factoid,[['p38 MAPK pathway']],"[['mitotic'], ['MAPK'], ['FA pathway'], ['Classical driver mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) typically affect regulators of cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The selective advantage of increased proliferation, improved survival, and reduced differentiation on leukemia progression is immediately obvious. Recent large-scale sequencing efforts have uncovered numerous novel AML-associated mutations. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of the most frequently mutated genes encode general regulators of transcription and chromatin state. Understanding the selective advantage conferred by these mutations remains a major challenge. A striking example are mutations in genes of the cohesin complex, a major regulator of three-dimensional genome organization'], ['deep transverse metatarsal']]",0
