What induces downstream of gene (DoG) readthrough transcription?,factoid,[['stress conditions']],"[['stress'], ['stress-induced changes in gene transcription have been shown to play a major role in stress responses and adaptation. Genome-wide studies reveal prevalent transcription beyond known protein-coding gene loci, generating a variety of RNA classes, most of unknown function. One such class, termed downstream of gene-containing transcripts (DoGs), was reported to result from transcriptional readthrough upon osmotic stress'], ['stress-induced transcriptional readthrough generates very long downstream of gene containing transcripts (DoGs), which may explain up to 20% of intergenic transcription. DoGs are induced by osmotic stress at the level of transcription by a mechanism that depends on calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by IP3 receptors. Here, we discuss DoG induction and function in the context of the literature, with special focus on 2 outstanding questions. First, we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying DoG induction through reduced transcription termination. Second, we explore how DoGs may function in maintaining euchromatin after nuclear scaffold stress'], ['Ca2+) is a key intracellular signaling molecule with far-reaching effects on many cellular processes. One of the most important such Ca2+regulated processes is transcription. A body of literature describes the effect of Ca2+signaling on transcription initiation as occurring mainly through activation of gene-specific transcription factors by Ca2+-induced signaling cascades. However, the reach of Ca2+extends far beyond the first step of transcription. In fact, Ca2+can regulate all phases of transcription, with additional effects on transcription-associated events such as alternative splicing. Importantly, Ca2+signaling mediates reduced transcription termination'], ['stress-induced transcriptional readthrough is a recently discovered phenomenon, in which stress conditions']]",?
